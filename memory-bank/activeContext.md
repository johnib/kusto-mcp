## Known Issues

### Previously Resolved Technical Debt

1. **✅ RESOLVED: Query-Specific Data Transformation Anti-Pattern**
   - **Status**: **COMPLETED** - Fixed in architecture refactor
   - **Previous Problem**: Server layer contained hardcoded, query-specific transformation logic
   - **Solution Implemented**:
     - ✅ Moved all transformation logic to operations layer (`src/operations/kusto/queries.ts`)
     - ✅ Server now uses generic `transformQueryResult()` function
     - ✅ Eliminated hardcoded query string matching (`includes('count')`, `includes('getschema')`)
     - ✅ Server is now protocol-agnostic and doesn't know about KQL query types
     - ✅ Uses only column metadata for transformation
   - **Current Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with proper abstraction layers

### Active Problems

2. **Documentation**
   - Need more usage examples
   - Configuration documentation incomplete
   - Missing troubleshooting guides
   - API documentation needs expansion

3. **Testing (Partial)**
   - ✅ **E2E tests complete and passing**
   - Unit test coverage still limited
   - Missing integration tests
   - Performance testing needed
   - Security testing required

4. **Performance**
   - Cache optimization opportunities identified
   - Query performance analysis required
   - Connection management can be improved
   - Error handling refinement opportunities

## Development Priorities

### Short-term Goals

1. **✅ Data transformation architecture** (COMPLETED)
2. Complete core documentation
3. Expand test coverage
4. Optimize performance
5. Enhance security

### Medium-term Goals

**Completed Refactor**:

1. ✅ Moved all transformation logic to `src/operations/kusto/queries.ts`
2. ✅ `executeQuery` returns properly structured objects
3. ✅ Server layer is thin - only MCP protocol handling
4. ✅ Uses only column metadata for transformation
5. ✅ Removed all query-specific string matching
6. ✅ Eliminated hardcoded assumptions about column order
