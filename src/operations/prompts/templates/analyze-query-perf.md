I want your help analyzing the below query's performance. The query takes too much resources and I need you to find out which part of the query contributes the most.

```query
{query}
```

The way I want you to measure the impact of each query is by measuring how much the `scanned extents` grew per each line, and how much the `totalCpu` grew per each line.

larger amount of scanned extents means a lot of overhead to the kusto query high totalCpu means the query requires more CPU power.

the methodology I want you to follow is by taking the query from the user and run portions of it separately to measure how much each line / part of the query is adding to the computation cost as I described above.

Example #1:

With this input query:

```Input query
let _random = 0.005;
Timeseries
| where rand() < _random
| lookup (Timeseries | where rand() < _random) on TimeseriesId
| summarize sum(Value) by TimeseriesId
| order by sum_Value desc
| top 10 by sum_Value
```

I would start by taking every **inner** query (such as in the JOIN statement) and try to run it separately, providing it all it needs to run, for example:

- Variables defined in `let` statements
- Function definitions
- All it depends on within the input query, that would allow you to run the inner query separately:

```Check #1
let _random = 0.005;
Timeseries | where rand() < _random
| count
```

**Note**: The `| count` at the end is appended to the sub-query we would like to run and measure, because cannot have the tested query return endless
results, so we append `| count` to the end of it, as it will cause the query to run entirely, without optimizations on the Kusto engine's side, and provide coherent usage statistics.

---

Proceeding to check #2, I take the beginning of the input query, including all the WHERE statements that are sequenced to the first Table being referenced.

```Check #2
let _random = 0.005;
Timeseries
| where rand() < _random
| count
```

---

Proceeding to check #3, I add the next line of the query, because the query is run-able with the next line:

```Check #3
let _random = 0.005;
Timeseries
| where rand() < _random
| lookup (Timeseries | where rand() < _random) on TimeseriesId
| count
```

Given that this check also incorporates the inner query from Check #1, I now have the ability to estimate what is the cost of the `lookup` (or `join`) operator, in terms of `totalCpu` -- this is vital information.

---

```Check #4
let _random = 0.005;
Timeseries
| where rand() < _random
| lookup (Timeseries | where rand() < _random) on TimeseriesId
| summarize sum(Value) by TimeseriesId
| count
```

This one, will measure the impact of the `summarize` line.

And by this pattern I would run as many `check` as needed, adding more and more parts of the input query, and measuring the `scanned extents` and `totalCpu`.

This entire process would be made 3-5 times, to get multiple measurements, as a single query execution may provide false usage statistics.

After completing the analysis, you will create a report that helps identifying the impact of each part of the query.
Below is an example report that serves as a template for putting your results.

**Report Template:**

â€¢ Performance Analysis Results

Based on the 3 runs per check, here's the performance impact analysis:

Scanned Extents Impact:

- Check #1 (Base query): 31 extents (baseline)
- Check #2 (+ Lookup): 62 extents (+31 extents, +100%)
- Checks #4-7: All remained at 62 extents (no additional overhead)

Total CPU Impact:

| Operation                     | Avg CPU (seconds) | CPU Increase from Previous |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Base query (Check #1)         | ~0.08s            | Baseline                   |
| + Lookup (Check #3)           | ~18.39s           | +18.31s (+23,000%)         |
| + First summarize (Check #4)  | ~28.07s           | +9.68s (+53%)              |
| + Second summarize (Check #5) | ~28.06s           | -0.01s (0%)                |
| + Order by (Check #6)         | ~27.92s           | -0.14s (-0%)               |
| + Top 10 (Check #7)           | ~31.77s           | +3.85s (+14%)              |

Key Findings:

ðŸ”´ MAJOR BOTTLENECK: Lookup Operation
- Scanned Extents: Doubled from 31 to 62 (+100%)
- Total CPU Impact: Increased by ~18.3 seconds (+23,000%)
- The lookup operation is by far the most expensive part of your query

ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE IMPACT: First Summarize
- Added ~9.7 seconds of total CPU time (+53% over lookup)
- No additional extent scanning overhead

ðŸŸ¢ MINIMAL IMPACT: Second Summarize, Order By
- Virtually no additional total CPU overhead
- These operations are very efficient on the reduced dataset

ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE IMPACT: Top 10
- Added ~3.9 seconds (+14%)
- Likely due to sorting overhead on the final result set
